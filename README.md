This is a game being developed using Python's gaming module Pygame. It is an ongoing project that I hope to keep adding to as my skills
with Python increase. Below is a list of features I have planed for the game 

1. Add rotation to meteors
2. Have animation of debris come off of meteor and/or ship when hit
3. Have animation of flame when player.ignite function is called
4. Add score and have text on screen 
5. Add health feature to the ship
